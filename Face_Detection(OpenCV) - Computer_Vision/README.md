# 🔎 Face Detection - Computer Vision 🕵🏼

## 🛠 Project Details:

This project implements real-time face detection in images using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library for Python. It leverages pre-trained Haarcascade classifiers to identify faces within images with high accuracy.

## 💻 Technologies Used :

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) (https://opencv.org/)

Matplotlib (Optional: for visualization) (https://matplotlib.org/)

Haarcascade Classifiers (Pre-trained face detection models) (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html)

## 🌟 How to run

Running the script is really simple! Just open a `terminal` and type `jupyter notebook` then hit `enter` key in the folder where your script is located and run the following command:
