# ðŸ”Ž Face Detection - Computer Vision 

## ðŸ›  Project Details:

This project implements real-time face detection in images using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library for Python. It leverages pre-trained Haarcascade classifiers to identify faces within images with high accuracy.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used :

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) (https://opencv.org/)

Haarcascade Classifiers (Pre-trained face detection models) (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V-EROj-3pEw)

Matplotlib (Optional: for visualization) (https://matplotlib.org/)

## ðŸŒŸ How to run

Running the script is really simple! Just open a `terminal` and type `jupyter notebook` then hit `enter` key in the folder where your script is located and run the following command:
